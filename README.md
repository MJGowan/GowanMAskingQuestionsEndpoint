Asking Questions - Endpoint
This program will ask questions. Specifically, mine asks for your favorite animal and your favorite food. Now compatible with postman

Peer review:// Noah - easy to read code looks awsome code matches subject

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/Questions/Favorite/(animal)/(food)
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /Questions/Favorite, and in the next two spaces I have labelled, you will enter your favorite animal and your favorite food. Then, hit "Send". Text should appear as if you have had a conversation, where the console will ask for your favorite animal and your favorite food, and respond to each answer.
